# Venus
___A 'go' like language that compiles into lua.___
The parsing part of this package was originally forked from ['luaparse'](https://oxyc.github.io/luaparse/).

### Language Features
  - Curly Brace Syntax (instead of `then` and `end`)
  - `foreach` keyword for iterating on objects
  - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `^=`, `.=`, `++` and `--` operators
  - `fn` instead of `function` (for nicer lambdas)
  - `(args) => {...}` style of function syntax.
  - `##` instead of `--` for comments
